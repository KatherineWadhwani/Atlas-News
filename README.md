# Acknowledgments:
    While no individual directly contributed to Atlas News other than the author, the following online resources proved helpful:
        - The Atlas logo was borrowed from the Atlas website at https://www.atlasfin.com/ .
        - Snigda Kansal, a former colleague, taught me how to implement the Dropdown Cards during my previous internship at Kommu. I have borrowed from her design (which may, in turn, have been borrowed from another source).
